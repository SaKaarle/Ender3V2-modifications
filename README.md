# Ender3V2-modifications
Mods of my Ender 3 V2 with .blend and .STL files
## Backing up .blend files
This repo is made for me to publicly upload my mods and methods I used for creating my own modifications.
## Why and what?
Personal backup, and helping myself to remember what tools I used and what I have done to make my ENDER 3V2 personal without any CAD background.
I'm trying to be crystal clear, open and link any of my mods that I remixed or modified. Not trying to break any rules as great as possible.
## Blender? Really?

- No CAD experience
- Blender usage is casual and can't say I am professional or experienced
- I'm "stupid" that I didn't taught myself CAD or other softwares, because it'd helped me
- Blender is "good" to mod premade STL files
I used a lot of tools from in-software tools and "un-official" ones. Listed:
- [CAD Sketcher](https://www.cadsketcher.com/) is lifesaving mod
- [QuickSnap](https://github.com/JulienHeijmans/quicksnap) from GitHub is great tool to help connecting pieces together
- [BlendShell](https://github.com/oormicreations/BlendShell) tool is in testing. Trying to make Ducts or something with this tool
- Precision Drawing Tools. Measuring Vector - Vector distances.
- 3D-Print Toolbox. Exporting STL easy way.
- LoopTools
- tinyCAD mesh tools
- Bool Tool (best)

# Example of ugly(really ugly) interface of mod(s)
If you are professional CAD user. It's not safe for work or life for you.
