# Ender3V2-modifications
Mods of my Ender 3 V2 with .blend and .STL files
## Backing up .blend files
This repo is made for me to publicly upload my mods and methods I used for creating my own modifications.
- No CAD experience
- Blender usage is casual and can't say I am professional or experienced
- I'm "stupid" that I didn't taught myself CAD or other softwares, because it'd helped me
- Blender is "good" to mod premade STL files
- [CAD Sketcher](https://www.cadsketcher.com/) is lifesaving mod
