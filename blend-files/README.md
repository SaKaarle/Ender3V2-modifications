## Main Duct mod
[Main duct mod is huge. 100mb and it's like test enviroment](https://github.com/SaKaarle/Ender3V2-modifications/blob/main/blend-files/ModdedVersionDuct.7z)
It has my old mods, tests etc. Didn't cleaned it.

It also contains the X-axis carriage mod for linear rails. It's remixed to have:
- thicker bottom for strenght. needs changes for belts. Straightening the belt by adding height piece before the holes. Easier way i'd guess. If I really wanted to strenght to that piece, I'd add 3 long M3 - M4 to press on belts.
- added 2 nut holes for BLTouch. Prolly going to change it due to the center screwhole is behind left side fanduct.
- leftside stopper for better switch action. Original didn't hit well on the switch so I added more contact area
- 2 holes that are unnecessary. Should be removed.
- Hotend screwholes. Originals were "odd" shaped and I changed them to cylinderlike shape. This gives me chance to change from my Hero Me Gen -mod to Frankenstein-Duct easly for example.

## Duct With No Name
It's Minimev4 or minionD mod fused with hero me gen. HMG has great ducts IMO and I added a support for it. It can be printed without BMS Dragonfly adapter to support MK8 style hotend.
It has little cable management for Thermistor and heater cable.

No heatinsert? no. I mod and print a lot so obviously it would've been waste of brass. 

It's integrated with Orbiter V2.0 extruder and added small flex support. 2 holes for zipties for cable

Modular BLTouch support that needs changes
