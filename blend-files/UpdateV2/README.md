Updated version:
Changes:
- Made changes to fanduct. Created "own" fan holes and lowered Orbiter extruder mount about 8mm downwards.
- Stronger (but flexing still on PET-G materials, not a surprise)
- Moved extruder holes 1mm towards front
- ADXL345 mount (not tested)
- BLTouch mount changes. Got annoying to change fans or what not. Made it more "easy" to access / mod. Not tested if it even fits or measured distance between BLTouch and nozzle.

Issues:
- Not tested
- Fan performance not tested. Model needs somekind of "duct" towards hotend.
